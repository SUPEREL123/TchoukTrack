Objective:
The objective of my project is to introduce and promote the sport of tchoukball using an innovative AI model. I believe this AI model is the world's first specifically designed for tchoukball, aimed at increasing awareness and interest in the sport.

Data Collection:
To gather the necessary data, I extensively searched for tchoukball photos on platforms like Google. I captured screenshots of numerous photos and compiled them into a dataset using a website called Roboflow.

Data Labelling:
Next, I meticulously labeled each photo in the dataset, ensuring accurate identification and classification of tchoukball-related elements.

Link to my Dataset:
For easy access, my dataset can be found at the following link: "https://universe.roboflow.com/ai-s8jse/tchouk-track"

AI Training:
To train the AI model, I utilized Google Colab, a powerful platform for machine learning. I employed YOLOv8, a popular object detection algorithm, to train the AI using the labeled photos from my dataset.

Deployment:
For presenting the results, I developed a user-friendly website using Streamlit. This website allows users to upload photos or videos related to tchoukball, and the AI model processes and displays the outcomes using Python.

By combining data collection, labeling, training, and deployment stages, I aim to create a comprehensive AI solution that promotes tchoukball and engages a wider audience through an interactive web interface.
